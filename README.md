# SamLib Informer

An attempt to port famous android application [samlib-Info](https://github.com/monakhv/samlib-Info)
to other platforms. Now the project is at a very early stage. Nevertheless, now it can:
  * add an author to the DB;
  * remove the author (with all books and book groups) from the DB;
  * check updates for a specific author(s) or for all known authors;
  * mark author/group books/book as read;
  * mark a book as un-read;
  * show list of known authors/group books/books;
  * create directory structure for books;
  * downloads books in `FB2` or `HTML` format into file;
